## Questions

1. I would pick within github actions because it would be able to find problems as I go through writing the code, which will make it so I can solve any problems that arise faster than if I would have left the testing to the end. 
2. No
3. The difference between navigation and snapshot mode is that navigation mode analyzes the page after it loads, while snapshot mode analyzes the page in its current state. Snapshot mode is best used for finding accessibility issues while navigation mode helps understand the overall performance of the webpage, which are split into 4 main metrics. 
4. Three things that we could do to improve the shop site are properly size images, preconnect to required origins, and add a meta description to the document.
